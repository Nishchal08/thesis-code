# Feature extraction notebook extracts the audio features from the processed audio
  Note: This notebook creates - `data/processed/features_16d.csv`  
- `data/processed/features_16d_scaled.csv` (zâ€‘scored)  
- `data/processed/scaler_standard.pkl` (for reuse)

# Dimentionality reduction reduces the extracted audio features to reqiured numbers of principle components and saves the cvs file extracted to data/processed
